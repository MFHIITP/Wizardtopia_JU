<body>
    1. Swear words must be avoided strictly, failiure of which will result in deduction of points from houses.
<br>
2. Since we're a club inside Jadavpur University and, of course, a civilized society, we must respect our seniors with the way they deserve it. Anyone disrespecting their seniors will be penalised. For normal students, it will be a deduction of 50 points on first such incident. For prefects and headboys/girls, it will be a straight deduction of 70 points along with expulsion from their designated post. For professors, it will be a deduction of 100 points along with expulsion from the job. In the second incident, he/she will be out of the club. However, everyone will be given a chance to prove themselves not guilty before punishment. If he/she is found to be rude there too, no wait will be done for the 2nd incident.
<br>
3. Leaving the group brings you a permanent ban from the club except. for mistaken leavings. Mistakenly left people will have to report it within 12 hours of the incident.
